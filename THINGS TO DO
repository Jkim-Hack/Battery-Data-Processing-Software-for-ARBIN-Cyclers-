THINGS TO DO:


1. CHANGE ALL GRAPHS SO THAT IT IS DEPENDENT ON CURRENT RATHER THAN STEP INDEX. 

2. MAKE CYCLE NUMBER GRAPH BE BASED ON THE STATISTICS SHEET RATHER THAN CURRENT SHEET.

2. MAKE THE METHOD ALGORITHMS MORE CONSICE IF POSSIBLE.

3. MAKE THE USER BE ABLE TO SELECT 3 CYCLE INDEXES AND SHOW THEM THE CYCLE INDEX NUMBER.

4. WHEN SELECTING THE FILE THE USER WANTS, MAKE THE FILE SHOW JUST THE NAME OF THE FILE RATHER THAN THE FILE STREAM.

5. MAKE THE NEW GRAPHS: COULOMBIC EFFICENCY, CYCLE INDEX VS CAPACITY (BOTH CHARGE AND DISCHARGE), DQ/DV WILL BE DISCUSSED IN A LATER TIME.

6. POLISH THINGS UP, MAKE A CREDITS TAB AND FINISH.
